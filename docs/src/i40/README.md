## Pratical Guild to join in Industry 4.0 - I4.0

I4.0 sought to unify and standardize different technologies so that traditional systems reach the concepts of "Advanced Manufacturing". The main aspects for migrating these systems deal with Cyber ​​Physical integration and virtualization of the different components so that they can be perceived in the virtual world.

>The virtualization of assets is standardized with concepts of AAS - Asset Administration Shell according to the guidelines of the I4.0 initiatives.
AAS is a concept that enables the Digital Twin - GD, in which it is a virtual copy of physical assets and components for bilateral communication of manufacturing objects.

The GD enables a better understanding of physical objects through digital models, the novelty will be that now there is an exchange between physical assets and virtual objects - virtual communication, as well as horizontal communication between different applications of the I4.0 systems.

>Virtual Objects - I4.0 Assets are enabled with the AAS concepts that standardize the different components of I4.0 - I4.0C.
With the transformation of traditional systems, I4.0 virtual systems can reach the factory of the future - Advanced Manufacturing Systems.
Now that we understand the potential of using AAS for asset virtualization and the use of digital applications, we can see the existing challenges for migrating from traditional manufacturing systems.

The current - traditional systems must be equipped with technologies and tools to achieve the GD.

>In this work, we will explore a methodology with defined steps and stages for the migration of traditional systems until we reach the AAS models, finally, a case study is conceived seeking to conceptualize the new approaches of digital models with the concepts of I4.0.


## Methodology used to define the method steps

### Legacy Systems

Traditional manufacturing systems were called in this article Legacy Systems - specifically designed to meet individual demands. Thus, legacy systems have their own architectures and specific production systems.

> In traditional manufacturing systems, distributed control systems are commonly used, supported by Programmable Logic Controls (PLCs) and basic programming languages ​​such as Ladder, Blocks, List. As mentioned in the introduction to this material, these systems need to be transformed into digital models to reach I4.0.

> The first stage of this work classifies an integration proposal that allows interoperability in unified languages ​​of the I4.0 components. The I4.0 standards describe the RAMI 4.0 - Reference Architecture Model for I4.0, being a three-dimensional model that contains layers, life cycle and traditional manufacturing hierarchy standard.

> The interoperability of traditional assets is possible using the AAS specified in I4.0. Before starting the manipulation and vision of the AAS, we will study models and architectures to connect the physical part (Traditional System) with the virtual components (Connected World - I4.0).

### Production Flow Scheme - PFS

The Production Flow Scheme (PFS) technique supports the modeling system of this work derivated from Petri Net (PN) being a representation of discrete event systems (DES).

> These systems allow the systematic decomposition of activities and their flows at a more abstract level, unlike UML (Unified Modeling Language), a language for modeling software. The PFS understands a high-level language independent of technologies and manufacturers widely used to design system processes

### Unified Modeling Language - UML

The class diagrams (UML - Unified Modeling Language) illustrate these elements at a higher level of detail, typical in object-oriented projects (OOP).

> The descriptions presented on the class diagrams do not depict the behavior for individual entities; for this reason, it needs models representing dynamic behavior and relationships between agents
