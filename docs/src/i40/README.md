## Pratical Guild to join in Industry 4.0 - I4.0

I4.0 sought to unify and standardize different technologies so that traditional systems reach the concepts of "Advanced Manufacturing". The main aspects for migrating these systems deal with Cyber ​​Physical integration and virtualization of the different components so that they can be perceived in the virtual world.

>The virtualization of assets is standardized with concepts of AAS - Asset Administration Shell according to the guidelines of the I4.0 initiatives.
AAS is a concept that enables the Digital Twin - GD, in which it is a virtual copy of physical assets and components for bilateral communication of manufacturing objects.

The GD enables a better understanding of physical objects through digital models, the novelty will be that now there is an exchange between physical assets and virtual objects - virtual communication, as well as horizontal communication between different applications of the I4.0 systems.

>Virtual Objects - I4.0 Assets are enabled with the AAS concepts that standardize the different components of I4.0 - I4.0C.
With the transformation of traditional systems, I4.0 virtual systems can reach the factory of the future - Advanced Manufacturing Systems.
Now that we understand the potential of using AAS for asset virtualization and the use of digital applications, we can see the existing challenges for migrating from traditional manufacturing systems.

The current - traditional systems must be equipped with technologies and tools to achieve the GD.

>In this work, we will explore a methodology with defined steps and stages for the migration of traditional systems until we reach the AAS models, finally, a case study is conceived seeking to conceptualize the new approaches of digital models with the concepts of I4.0.
