## Pratical Guild to join in Industry 4.0 - I4.0

I4.0 sought to unify and standardize different technologies so that traditional systems reach the concepts of "Advanced Manufacturing". The main aspects for migrating these systems deal with Cyber ​​Physical integration and virtualization of the different components so that they can be perceived in the virtual world.

>The virtualization of assets is standardized with concepts of AAS - Asset Administration Shell according to the guidelines of the I4.0 initiatives.
AAS is a concept that enables the Digital Twin - GD, in which it is a virtual copy of physical assets and components for bilateral communication of manufacturing objects.

The GD enables a better understanding of physical objects through digital models, the novelty will be that now there is an exchange between physical assets and virtual objects - virtual communication, as well as horizontal communication between different applications of the I4.0 systems.

>Virtual Objects - I4.0 Assets are enabled with the AAS concepts that standardize the different components of I4.0 - I4.0C.
With the transformation of traditional systems, I4.0 virtual systems can reach the factory of the future - Advanced Manufacturing Systems.
Now that we understand the potential of using AAS for asset virtualization and the use of digital applications, we can see the existing challenges for migrating from traditional manufacturing systems.

The current - traditional systems must be equipped with technologies and tools to achieve the GD.

>In this work, we will explore a methodology with defined steps and stages for the migration of traditional systems until we reach the AAS models, finally, a case study is conceived seeking to conceptualize the new approaches of digital models with the concepts of I4.0.


## Methodology used to define the method steps

### Legacy Systems

Traditional manufacturing systems were called in this article Legacy Systems - specifically designed to meet individual demands. Thus, legacy systems have their own architectures and specific production systems.

> In traditional manufacturing systems, distributed control systems are commonly used, supported by Programmable Logic Controls (PLCs) and basic programming languages ​​such as Ladder, Blocks, List. As mentioned in the introduction to this material, these systems need to be transformed into digital models to reach I4.0.

> The first stage of this work classifies an integration proposal that allows interoperability in unified languages ​​of the I4.0 components. The I4.0 standards describe the RAMI 4.0 - Reference Architecture Model for I4.0, being a three-dimensional model that contains layers, life cycle and traditional manufacturing hierarchy standard.

> The interoperability of traditional assets is possible using the AAS specified in I4.0. Before starting the manipulation and vision of the AAS, we will study models and architectures to connect the physical part (Traditional System) with the virtual components (Connected World - I4.0).

### First Step - Integration of Legacy Systems

RAMI 4.0 addresses guidelines for developing applications in the I4.0 context. Legacy systems that use classic control architectures need to be transformed into virtual models with AAS support.

> Currently, different works propose the gradual migration of legacy systems, for example the IMPROVE or PERFoRM projects, however it is observed that these present specific proposals or a very generic architecture that must be followed to design the models for each use case.

> Taking into account the approaches and concepts mentioned, the first stage of the methodology of this work deals with the "INTEGRATION" of legacy systems from manufacturing to AAS. In this sense, we will now discuss the means for interface, the protocols that should be used, such as OPC-UA.

We will then follow the layered model of RAMI 4.0 to meet the standardization requirements of the languages ​​of the legacy system, the I4.0 language - OPC-UA. Thus physical assets will now be considered I4.0 - I4.0C components.

> I4.0C must be unique, identifiable and meet communication requirements. An I.4.0 according to the descriptions of I4.0 can range from a sensor to an entire work plant, therefore, in this study we will consider I4.0C workstation modules, such as: Robotic Arm, Handling Station, Packing Machine

#### Details of RAMI 4.0 Layers for communication migration from Legacy Systems.

The I4.0 Guidance X document simplifies the layers responsible for applications and integration tools for exchanging data between the physical and virtual element of the AAS.

> The OPC-UA is used as a standardization protocol for the different languages ​​of legacy systems. Allowing data exchange between these layers uses standard XML or JSON protocol.

#### Framework for transforming legacy assets into AAS

In this study, we will use a basic structure of AAS that exchange data with legacy devices. Thus we consider: a) Active Workstation; b) Asset Product; c) Active Integrator.

> The workstation actually deals with the existing legacy system, the active product refers to hardware inserted in the control system that collects data from the flow of the part in the workstations, while the active integrator is also a second board containing the OPC tools -UA and XML models for collecting and converting data to virtual models, finally there is a computer containing the I4.0 framework with images of each physical asset using AAS concepts (we will not detail this in this first step).

> The PC asset deals with orchestrators and frameworks containing AAS, the "Integrator" asset allows connecting heterogeneous field protocols via OPC-UA from workstations and product assets, enabling the flow of data between the physical layer and the functional layer - containing the AAS.

> Finally, in the lower part of the figure, the industry's legacy control systems were designed. Note that these are equipped with a port for OPC-DA communication via Ethernet TCP/IP. Thus, in the Integrator, the Matrikon-OPC tool was used for the communication of the assets - Station.

> Figure-x is about the simplified flow of information between station assets, integrator asset and PC-AAS asset.

### Second Step - Modeling of the virtual part of the AAS.

After enabling the traditional systems to be perceived by the new I4.0 systems, it is necessary to design the AAS models.

 * In this step, we use the concepts of the I4.0 guidelines:

> An AAS can be a physical asset or not, for example, processes, products, stations, controllers, resources, drawings, etc. In this study we will focus on the standardization of resources using AAS. The Asset Administration Shell (AAS) is the composition of the "Asset" and the "Administration Shell", this one is conceived as a meta-model made up of different sub-models that describe the attributes of the asset - resource.

> The main parts of an AAS are the header - responsible for standardized identification and the body - which makes up the other sub-models of the asset's domain.

> The AAS comprises a minimal set of submodels that allowed the “asset” to perform a specific function.

 * A sub-model deals with specific aspects of the resource, for example:

 > means of communication, functionalities and services, standard identifiers.

### Production Flow Scheme - PFS

The Production Flow Scheme (PFS) technique supports the modeling system of this work derivated from Petri Net (PN) being a representation of discrete event systems (DES).

> These systems allow the systematic decomposition of activities and their flows at a more abstract level, unlike UML (Unified Modeling Language), a language for modeling software. The PFS understands a high-level language independent of technologies and manufacturers widely used to design system processes

### Unified Modeling Language - UML

The class diagrams (UML - Unified Modeling Language) illustrate these elements at a higher level of detail, typical in object-oriented projects (OOP).

> The descriptions presented on the class diagrams do not depict the behavior for individual entities; for this reason, it needs models representing dynamic behavior and relationships between agents
