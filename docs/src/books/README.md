>Traditional manufacturing systems need proposals that describe methods for adherence to the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) context. The I4.0 guidelines demonstrate the need for self-organization and plug-and-produce (plug and produce), demanding greater flexibility in current applications. The virtualization of different components is promising for replicating real systems in the virtual environment. One area that needs attention is the different relationships and tasking of resources so that they can be understood in the virtual world. The concept of Asset-Administration Shell (AAS) provides a standardization for the virtualization of industry asset data, in addition to introducing the concept of capability engineering, meeting the requirements of an active virtual product in the production flow. The cooperation of the different abilities of the resources can be achieved with the support of control applications that carry out the choice of functionalities and grouping of the different attributes of the information. In this context, the current work proposes a method for controlling and coalition of resources of a productive system based on multi-agent, through virtualization
