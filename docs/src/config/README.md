  **Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)**

Intelligent agents and autonomous agents is a sub-area of artificial intelligence where these agents decide, in a reactive or proactive, about a course of action, reasoning on the available information about the world (including the environment, the agent itself, and other agents). In MARL, the RL is coupled aiming to share variables and parameters that will be considered requirements for model validation.

  **Multi-Agent Oriented Programming (MAOP)**

Agent-oriented programming (MAOP) was proposed in Boissier et al. (2013), seeking to support the MAS paradigm at the programming level. This technique is still a recent approach and they are usually used by tricks in traditional languages ​​such as Java, C++, Python, etc. In this material, I will talk a little about MAOP semantics, its challenges and I will present recent experiments for designing MAS scripts.

  **Data analysis, processing and transformation**

Data analysis in the context of this work will be used for validation of models, generation of graphs and large amount of data from multiple simulations in parallel. It is expected in this project to analyze scenarios considering random planning, optimization of machine learning and deep learning techniques for agent feedback.

  **Digital Assets and Process Simulation**

- Aerospace simulations in the military context require detailed models and suitable for the study context,consequently the optimization of paths for air spaces,
can be treated as a complex problem, which involves different models for simulation, analysis and validation.
- In the Manufacturing Systems, was presented the digital twin (DT) as a virtual representation of an object or system, the models is updated from real-time data, and uses simulation, machine learning and reasoning to help decision-making. These cases it can be supported by both discrete event or continuous-time simulations.

  **Software Architectures and Assets Models**

Modeling and Simulation (M&S) is widely used in the aerospace industry to create trusted components for analysis and data generation as close to the real environment.
In this project it is intended to advance in the studies and modeling skills acquired during the master's degree, however these are adequate for the study subjects, as for the modeling of dynamic behavior of assets, modeling of the simulation environment of other components, such as environments, components and others of importance for validation of the study hypothesis.
