My name is Jackson T. Veiga. I am from São Paulo, Brazil. I am qualified as an Electrical Engineer with an M.Sc. degree in Mechatronics Engineering. At the moment I am working as a Researcher and Developer of Fullstack at the Brazilian Air Force`s Institute of Advanced Studies (IEAv). I have been interested in algorithms and data structures and their implementations especially to help the community that deals with manufacturing optimization and digitization. In my master's degree, I made a method proposal for controlling the selection of attributes in the context of a virtual resource based on the Simulation of Multi-Agents. Later on, I got acquainted with DevOps implementing web services - setup and simulation station using docker with Django, Vue, and Leaflet. I continue my research with models and simulation, in several fields: aerospace with research in UAVs and Swarm social agents to control air planning. Recent studies have been in the modeling of optimizers, deep learning, tree behavior, and integration of different technologies.
