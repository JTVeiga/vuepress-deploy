## Time Travel

>Through the subtle laws of the universe, we can go anywhere. The same freedom can happen on the emotional levels where man frees himself from events and natural laws, thus expanding contact with HIS superior image and, not depending on the mental plane.
The relationship between these two beings happens at supernatural levels, being more stable and not subject to the different characteristics of the physical plane.

## Rezo Groups Flow in SJC

>On full moon nights, we went to the sea to feed on fish and shellfish. We sang and danced around the fire while the sea hit the rocks - "patá" and the sea replied - "xó". (Pataxós Indigenous Tribe - BR).

## Institute of Advanced Studies (IEAv)

> The hexagon, in addition to generating the structural lines of architectural construction, is also the geometric shape that symbolizes perfection within the teachings of the wisest cultures on the planet. The hexagonal pyramid, arising from the lines drawn by Lieutenant Colonel Aviator Reginaldo dos Santos, generated the suggestion that now forms the symbol of the activities of the IEAv institute - Institute for Advanced Studies of the Brazilian Air Force. At the apex of its six sides, the stone shines, reflecting the light of the institution that - from above - hurts the scholar's pupil and makes him glimpse the revealed knowledge.

## I want to be like a bird in Nature

I realize how hard it is to take care of the earth. Do we really care?

>Perhaps the thought of caring is currently closer to exploring. In fact, we have to place ourselves in the position of participating in Nature, as an element that cools and does not produce threats - intruders.
So, in this position that I stand in, I am now a tool of Mother Earth. I observe the birds that visit me this morning, just like them I want to continuously carry out this work.


## We are more than dimensional beings.

Why were we guided to lead a life in which we ignore the senses and sensations?

> It is more convenient to leave aside the aspects that exist within us, than to deal with the demand to get in and out of certain situations, without having the perception that these can be understood in other realities.

> In nature - a guava tree is bearing fruit, is it aware that its fruits cooperate with other beings, does it understand being part of the whole?

## Walking too fast.

I always walked very fast, very fast, trying maybe to get away, but from what? of my own!

> Walking to reach the setting sun, so fast that I don't move anymore, then I suddenly stopped.

>I stopped and began to observe, observe and follow slowly, trying to readapt myself, try again and, who knows, in this emptiness find myself again.

## Where do you hide?

Where do you hide? How did you get this "breastplate", how many characters did you create to hide from you, where are you?

> What do you have left when getting rid of yourself, these many layers? What does your being appreciate at this moment? Is there something in this emptiness, can it touch its essence, in any of these places, in these created scenarios, do you exist or is it the fruit of your imagination?

## I'm prosperous and satisfied with my presence

I don't want anything if I'm not here, I'm not looking for fame, I'm prosperous and satisfied with my presence.

>My wealth is born in my being, I don't contain them so I want to share. I am fed up, I renew myself and remake myself at all times. The routine does not describe me, but I make it a necessary walk. I walk in the paths I traced, I follow in no direction, but always guarded by its traces.

## Good I saw you

Here I am again with internal thoughts and better understanding of the manifestation that reflects where I stand.

> The hope, that the condition would return to its pristine state, but that the corners, come to remind me that here I am. I'm a part of this and it's up to me to generate the energy to move forward.

> At this stage, all Natural beauty supports transformation and, we observe just reminds me every day the price or gratuity for molding me up to that dimension. Watching myself from this point makes me happy to understand what I felt without knowing it, but now.

> Perhaps, with the tools to transmute,

> These are simple words, exchanging, sharing, fulfilling the individual role in the whole. It's up to us to continue neglecting or enter the mission body and soul. Last night under an ignorant optic, which called fantasy, even so, the realms made gifts, bringing healing to this machine. Its grandeur, now experienced in different ways, the magic of that love that overflows, and which invites us to share it every morning.

In that same play I talk to them asking for directions.

>The answers are so sensitive to the point of getting lost again in my linear reasoning. The transformation we seek will never be achieved without first getting rid of this individual and mechanized system. The promise to hold on to their sovereignty, some share over our senses, others camouflage themselves in majesty. Again, the message, not one or the other, but the knowledge of its existence in this great web. Each holarchy is governed by an individual form and sustained by an uncountable one, which transmutes at every moment.

> These sounds, vibrations and different feelings are donated to the next person to carry out the continuity of the great existence, sovereign, perpetual and infinite, which in our understanding is disguised in the void. It is infinite, real and sacred,

> I saw you!

![Alt text](/Trip01.jpg "Viagen Inicio")

When I started, I didn't know what I might find. I didn't have a well-defined plan, just a desire to live every moment, to meet new people around the corner.

> Following this road and finding similar people with the same motivation, making exchanges and developing this dream, takes it off paper and little by little consolidates it as my lifestyle.

> I wanted to learn along the way, I didn't want it to be perfect, because it never is.. An atypical trip without a destination, but with a well-defined mission to come back better and bring a lot of experience back with you.. JT Veiga, 02/13, Beginning of the journey to connect with me

## VIEW FROM THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN

> As far as it is from blossoming it sustains its splendor in noticing them reach the skies then the warrior from the top of the mountain, saw the your beauty, and on this day you will be grateful reinvigorating your energies for the next battle...

## THE WARRIOR

> They are calling me to combat,
  but tired of fighting causes
  others, like a good warrior
  don't dare to be a show
  in the eyes of yesteryear,
  So, you want to rest in front of
  of your own battle, glimpse
  your own pains and so,
  no but the warrior goes
  and stay an admirer of your own journey..

## WORDS FROM THE SOUL

> The great mystery consists in the simplicity of opening our heart. Despite the effort I make now to convey the message, this one is not can be transformed into rationalized words, as it is a simple way we manage to survive. I wish it could put on paper what I feel right now, from
of my prayers that I raise to the heavens, portals open between my body and connects with the great I am. I feel you present in the singing of distant birds, but around of this majestic dance. An integration becomes inexplicable, but it is up to us feel, to thank with all due respect for all the present effort that still take care of us.

## SATURDAY AFTERNOON

> This Saturday afternoon, I'm looking for natural pleasures, but that's not it.
What do the vast majority do? move from one place to another, like animals
rational, letting their reasons emerge, but it is in the universal and subtle knowledge
that I cling to and your presence is enough for me here, in these two square meters.
The will is to fly like the birds, I completely disintegrate from this naturalness
letting me join the great conscience.
However, fear still prevents me from moving away from my loved ones, they are sleeping..
Understanding that they have a special mission in my life. Process or
maturation in search of union with those who provide energy for advancement.

## TRANSITION MOMENT FOR HUMANITY

> The message was not so clear, or rather, I lack tools for understanding
it is necessary to trust unknown beings, but who make gifts in
channels of pure garments. The transition is happening, new concepts of mind that
they mix intellect, feeling and reason. The energy we receive goes beyond this
state of consciousness, therefore, meditations and training in this new area is necessary.
Between this message, I cling to the understanding that DEFORMATION will be the return
of the majority of the species the origin. Those who cling and transform again
in primitive beings. On the other hand, a select group that supports us chooses the transition
from which new possibilities enter...
It is not new that a present group seeks super-powers, these can be
mixed with EGO and a great desire for control. We call them special beings
enter environments that we find as owners, or true heirs of this reign.
However, in my research, it is noted that those who are less concerned with the domain
and power, as true members of that universal consciousness.
A possible unity, but an illusion of our minds? because the message I get here
approaches the simplicity of being..
The doubt remains about, the animal that emerges or the being of Light that transits to a
high environment out of these feelings?

## LIVING BETWEEN TWO WORLDS

> The only certainty we have will be the coexistence within the unit of natural time,
no rush to pass. Living in the present, exploring parallel times and understanding
this invitation, if we are allowed to do so. But understand the mysteries and reach the
maximum efficiency in this dimension, that too is a gift.

## RESPECT THE UNIVERSAL DANCE

>Respect your nature, nourish yourself with the offerings of our mother's womb while
available, the treaty is fulfilled while others feed, even if they reach
other lifting methods. Watch the animals, and respect the deal while we're at it.
here. The machine of this reality depends on these resources, so let's continue our dance
universal until it is fulfilled.
