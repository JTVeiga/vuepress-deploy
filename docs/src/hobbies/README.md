## Time Travel

>Through the subtle laws of the universe, we can go anywhere. The same freedom can happen on the emotional levels where man frees himself from events and natural laws, thus expanding contact with HIS superior image and, not depending on the mental plane.
The relationship between these two beings happens at supernatural levels, being more stable and not subject to the different characteristics of the physical plane.

## Rezo Groups Flow in SJC

>On full moon nights, we went to the sea to feed on fish and shellfish. We sang and danced around the fire while the sea hit the rocks - "patá" and the sea replied - "xó". (Pataxós Indigenous Tribe - BR).

## Institute of Advanced Studies (IEAv)

> The hexagon, in addition to generating the structural lines of architectural construction, is also the geometric shape that symbolizes perfection within the teachings of the wisest cultures on the planet. The hexagonal pyramid, arising from the lines drawn by Lieutenant Colonel Aviator Reginaldo dos Santos, generated the suggestion that now forms the symbol of the activities of the IEAv institute - Institute for Advanced Studies of the Brazilian Air Force. At the apex of its six sides, the stone shines, reflecting the light of the institution that - from above - hurts the scholar's pupil and makes him glimpse the revealed knowledge.

## I want to be like a bird in Nature

I realize how hard it is to take care of the earth. Do we really care?

>Perhaps the thought of caring is currently closer to exploring. In fact, we have to place ourselves in the position of participating in Nature, as an element that cools and does not produce threats - intruders.
So, in this position that I stand in, I am now a tool of Mother Earth. I observe the birds that visit me this morning, just like them I want to continuously carry out this work.


## We are more than dimensional beings.

Why were we guided to lead a life in which we ignore the senses and sensations?

> It is more convenient to leave aside the aspects that exist within us, than to deal with the demand to get in and out of certain situations, without having the perception that these can be understood in other realities.

> In nature - a guava tree is bearing fruit, is it aware that its fruits cooperate with other beings, does it understand being part of the whole?

## Walking too fast.

I always walked very fast, very fast, trying maybe to get away, but from what? of my own!

> Walking to reach the setting sun, so fast that I don't move anymore, then I suddenly stopped.

>I stopped and began to observe, observe and follow slowly, trying to readapt myself, try again and, who knows, in this emptiness find myself again.

## Where do you hide?

Where do you hide? How did you get this "breastplate", how many characters did you create to hide from you, where are you?

> What do you have left when getting rid of yourself, these many layers? What does your being appreciate at this moment? Is there something in this emptiness, can it touch its essence, in any of these places, in these created scenarios, do you exist or is it the fruit of your imagination?

## I'm prosperous and satisfied with my presence

I don't want anything if I'm not here, I'm not looking for fame, I'm prosperous and satisfied with my presence.

>My wealth is born in my being, I don't contain them so I want to share. I am fed up, I renew myself and remake myself at all times. The routine does not describe me, but I make it a necessary walk. I walk in the paths I traced, I follow in no direction, but always guarded by its traces.

## Good I saw you

Here I am again with internal thoughts and better understanding of the manifestation that reflects where I stand.

> The hope, that the condition would return to its pristine state, but that the corners, come to remind me that here I am. I'm a part of this and it's up to me to generate the energy to move forward.

> At this stage, all Natural beauty supports transformation and, we observe just reminds me every day the price or gratuity for molding me up to that dimension. Watching myself from this point makes me happy to understand what I felt without knowing it, but now.

> Perhaps, with the tools to transmute,

> These are simple words, exchanging, sharing, fulfilling the individual role in the whole. It's up to us to continue neglecting or enter the mission body and soul. Last night under an ignorant optic, which called fantasy, even so, the realms made gifts, bringing healing to this machine. Its grandeur, now experienced in different ways, the magic of that love that overflows, and which invites us to share it every morning.

In that same play I talk to them asking for directions.

>The answers are so sensitive to the point of getting lost again in my linear reasoning. The transformation we seek will never be achieved without first getting rid of this individual and mechanized system. The promise to hold on to their sovereignty, some share over our senses, others camouflage themselves in majesty. Again, the message, not one or the other, but the knowledge of its existence in this great web. Each holarchy is governed by an individual form and sustained by an uncountable one, which transmutes at every moment.

> These sounds, vibrations and different feelings are donated to the next person to carry out the continuity of the great existence, sovereign, perpetual and infinite, which in our understanding is disguised in the void. It is infinite, real and sacred,

> I saw you!
