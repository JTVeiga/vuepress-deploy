### Simulation with NETLOGO
![Alt text](/NETLOGO_Simuation.png "NETLOGO Simulation")
> NetLogo is a multi-agent programmable modeling environment. It is used by many hundreds of thousands of students, teachers, and researchers worldwide.

> NetLogo is a simple programming language adapted to modelling/simulating natural and/or social phenomena:

 >is suitable for modeling complex systems that evolve over time,
 is suitable for modeling hundreds or thousands of individuals (people, bacteria, insects, nations, organizations, etc.) that interact with each other and with the environment,
 it allows exploring the connection between local interactions between individuals and the macroscopic patterns emerging from these same interactions.

### State Transition Test - FSM Simulation
![Alt text](/FSM_BuyTicket.png "FSM Simulation")
> "Finite State Machine" (abbreviated FSM), also called "State Machine" or "Finite State Automaton" is an abstract machine consisting of a set of states (including the initial state and one or more final states), a set of input events, a set of output events, and a state transition function.
> A state machine can be simulated and validated using Petri Net (PN) techniques.
> In this example we treat a ticket purchase process, these techniques are used as concepts for "State Transition Test" - TTE: TTE is a black box testing technique for observing the behavior of a given system by applying different input conditions and verifying that the system's behavior is met.

* Authors: Jackson Veiga
* Service Detail: State Machine Basic Simulators, Discret Event Systems, Petri Net Diagrams, State Transition Test Diagramas Validator.

### Dashboards to Business Analytics
![Alt text](/Dashboards_Flask.png "Dashboards")
> Dashboards are widely used as management tools, from which you can check key indicators, perform analysis, metrics, business statistics and processes such as production.
> Business analytics is a promising area in the digital age for exploring and investigating application performance, gaining insights and driving new plans..

* Authors: Jackson Veiga
* Service Detail: Build indicators of applications, processes, maintenance, production, manufacturing, platform access flow, among other digital applications that are oriented to data analysis and statistics..

### Material List JSON to Table
![Alt text](/JSONtoTABLE.PNG.png "Material_List")
> One of the tools widely used in engineering is excel tables, naturally we create tables for everything: List of Materials, List of Components, Budget, Planning, Costs, Specifications, Detailed Projects, among others. I think we can improve the manual creation of these tables using standard data structures, for example JSON, so we focus on the component specifications, letting IT services be able to make the final generation of the tables more flexible. In this service example I make a small test considering the conversion of an Array into tables for visualization as we are used to doing.

* Authors: Jackson Veiga
* Service Detail: List of Materials, List of Components, Budget, Planning, Costs, Specifications, Detailed Projects, among others.

### Machine Automation JSON-Schema
![Alt text](/JSON_MachineA.png "Machine_A")

> JSON has gained momentum in API code programming and web services because it helps in faster data interchange and web service results. It is text-based, lightweight, and has an easy-to-parse data format requiring no additional code for parsing. Programmers, developers, and IT professionals need to transfer populated data structures from any language to formats that are recognizable by other languages and platforms. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is the data-exchange format that makes this possible.

* Authors: Jackson Veiga
* Service Detail: Is standardization of data exchange important to you? With JSON we can perform parsing or serialization, standardization of the data structure for network exchange, temporary data storage, interoperability between systems, loading data on the web, credentials, log file, temporary component data, among other services..

## SOFTWARE DESIGN WITH UML DIAGRAMS

### Machine Automation Diagram
![Alt text](/MachineDiagram.jpg "Machine_01")

> In the digitization of the industry, assets must be digitized, so semantic definitions and tool support for modeling and designing software artifacts are necessary. A library for these automation elements can be created by manufacturers and developers..

* Authors: Jackson Veiga (Agents)
* Service Detail: development of automation digital libraries, creation of block diagrams, UML, entity relationship diagrams, use of POO or POC programming paradigms, design of different components in programming language, creation of APIs, JSON or UML interface elements for data exchange between applications.

### Component Diagram - UML
![Alt text](/DiagramaBlocosVeiga.jpg "Veiga_UML_01")

> A component diagram can be used to represent applications by highlighting the relationship between components. Components can have interfaces (ie abstract classes with operations) that allow associations between components.

* Authors: Jackson Veiga (Agents)
* Service Detail: artifacts they are made of such as source code files, programming libraries, or relational database tables.

### Sequence Diagram - UML
![Alt text](/DgraSeq.png "Veiga_UML_02")

> Sequence diagrams and collaboration diagrams are used to define the behavior of groups of objects. Usually, one interaction diagram captures the behavior of one use case. These diagrams are mainly used to define basic interactions between objects at the level of method invocation

* Authors: Jackson Veiga
* Service Detail: - The sequence diagram is used in UML to represent the sequence of software processes, logics, behaviors of multiple applications or an individual routine, as well as it can handle the interaction between components, as is the case of this figure. I provide the various services both at a more granular level for architecting software processes and at more detailed levels such as the example dealing with the interaction of the sequence of events between software agents.

### CLasse Diagram - UML
![Alt text](/DiagramaClasseUML.jpg "Veiga_UML_03")

> Class diagrams clearly map the structure of a given system by modeling its classes, attributes, operations and relationships between objects

* Authors: Jackson Veiga (I4.0 Guild)
* Service Detail: in this service we can either represent the general structure of the software architecture at a higher level of detail compared to the block diagram, that is, providing a view of the methods and attributes of each class that exists in the software. The example in the figure deals with the representation of classes of a virtual resource AAS, following object-oriented programming, however we can follow other concepts such as POC - Component or Agent Oriented Programming. Soon below, classes will be detailed following a structure of services that we can design together.

## SIMULATION AND DISCRETE-EVENT SIMULATION (DES)


### Production Flow Scheme (PFS)

![Alt text](/DiagramaPFS.jpg "Veiga_PFS_01")

> The Production Flow Scheme (PFS) technique supports the modeling system of this work derivated from Petri Net (PN) being a representation of discrete event systems (DES). The PFS understands a high-level language independent of technologies and manufacturers widely used to design system processes.

* Authors: Jackson Veiga
* Service Detail:  a generic language for modeling software process based, these systems allow the systematic decomposition of activities and their flows at a more abstract level. Using this technique we can simplify and establish the sequencing of software processes and methods, as well as architectures, communications between components, detailing complex parts and activities, behaviors, among other use cases.

### Petri Nets (PN)

![Alt text](/RedePetri.png "PetriNet_01")

> Petri nets constitute a mathematical formalism capable of representing digital systems at a very high level of abstraction. Its structural aspect
is equivalent to a directed and bipartite graph composed of three elements basic elements, namely, states, actions and arcs

* Authors: Jackson Veiga
* Service Detail: Petri net allows evaluating the structure and dynamic behavior of the modeled system. Analyze system behavior, modeling the functioning of applications, processes, agent behavior, complex architectures, programming and control logic, production flows, manufacturing processes, among others.
