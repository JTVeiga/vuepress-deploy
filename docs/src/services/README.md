## UML Diagrams

### Component Diagram - UML
![Alt text](/DiagramaBlocosVeiga.jpg "Veiga_UML_01")

> A component diagram can be used to represent applications by highlighting the relationship between components. Components can have interfaces (ie abstract classes with operations) that allow associations between components.

* Authors: Jackson Veiga (Agents)
* Service Detail: artifacts they are made of such as source code files, programming libraries, or relational database tables.

### Sequence Diagram - UML

> Sequence diagrams and collaboration diagrams are used to define the behavior of groups of objects. Usually, one interaction diagram captures the behavior of one use case. These diagrams are mainly used to define basic interactions between objects at the level of method invocation

* Authors: Jackson Veiga
* Service Detail: - The sequence diagram is used in UML to represent the sequence of software processes, logics, behaviors of multiple applications or an individual routine, as well as it can handle the interaction between components, as is the case of this figure. I provide the various services both at a more granular level for architecting software processes and at more detailed levels such as the example dealing with the interaction of the sequence of events between software agents.

### CLasse Diagram - UML

> Class diagrams clearly map the structure of a given system by modeling its classes, attributes, operations and relationships between objects

* Authors: Jackson Veiga (I4.0 Guild)
* Service Detail: in this service we can either represent the general structure of the software architecture at a higher level of detail compared to the block diagram, that is, providing a view of the methods and attributes of each class that exists in the software. The example in the figure deals with the representation of classes of a virtual resource AAS, following object-oriented programming, however we can follow other concepts such as POC - Component or Agent Oriented Programming. Soon below, classes will be detailed following a structure of services that we can design together.
