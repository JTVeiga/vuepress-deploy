## Sw Tester

Software development applications can be tested considering the user view of the application. A methodology for carrying out these tests can consider both "exploratory" techniques, when the developer only explores the application's functionalities.

#### Planning Tests:
> planning tests can be done from a set of manual tests, thus listing all the application's resources, input sets and expected results after we run each code segment. In this method, the procedures described for each resource are used, then the functionality of the resources is tested from a set of inputs and a set of responses is expected to be reached as output data.

The automation tests make it possible to execute the test plans, so we define which applications we want to test the sequence of tests, the expected responses - "every interface that would be performed by a home is planned and written in machine language". Currently there are tools and libraries ready in different languages ​​to help them in these tests.

### Integration Tests:
> Several components of the application are tested, thus, in the integration test, it is verified how the components of your application operate with each other.

### Unit Testes:
> Unit tests consist of a more detailed level at which each application component or piece of code is checked. In this test, the components are listed, what are the attributions of each part - expected functionalities, what is the input set, how these must be registered and processed, what are the possible failures and results that this component should have from the execution of its functionalities turn back.
