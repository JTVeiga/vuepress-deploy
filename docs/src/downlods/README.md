Our goal is to create an area to share digital knowledge offering classes and consulting:

###  **NEXT bank report - How to use this information to offer assistance and services customized for our customers.**

> Seeking to better answer this question, an exploratory analysis of the scenario was carried out banks in a digital context. There is a growth at the end of 2019 of 53.6% in global population of people using online devices according to (Internet Technology) Information and Communication - ICT) (Pucihar, 2017).

> In this report you will find studies carried out about the proposed theme with qualitative and quantitative analyzes in addition to the proposal of a data analysis method for creating a PoC using Design Thinking and CRISP-DM

###  **Development of a forecasting system demand and consortiation in productive models and of planting in the CSA.**

> The world is increasingly interconnected, thus demanding new practices that place sustainable measures at the center.
You Agroecosystems are options to minimize the impacts caused by humanity to the environment.
The conventional model of organization of the food production and distribution chain is linked to financial and industrial capital,
these do not have a strong connection with final consumers, not respecting the seasonality of planting times, having poles
massive production processes that use soil and genetic alterations to meet large-scale demand. On the other hand, the
Communities Sustained by Agriculture - CSA, create a direct relationship with the community respecting the seasonality of planting and
seeking to deliver a basket of products according to the season.
Current global food production mechanisms are in the upper production cycle, targeting profit and price, in the other direction
the lower circuits stand out, in this context there is a direct approximation between producers and consumers, consequently
eliminating commercial intermediaries. In this modality, the foods are grown by season, so there is a need to
creation of relationship matrices to improve smallholders' planning and strengthen individual systems of
production.
Decisions in this field are normally centered on periodic meetings in which voting takes place, so surveys are valid.
that seek to create intelligent systems to support different groups of producers based on historical and different information
relating the processes involved in the system.
The focus of the CSA is the structuring of local community networks that bring together those who produce and those who consume, this partnership seeks to healthy relationships in the field. Cooperativism is inspired by the concept of “associative economy”, with the well-being of
all the people involved, with community being a common goal.

###  **JSON - Example of JSON Machine Object**

> The JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format is an open format used as an alternative to XML for transferring structured data between a web server and a web application. Its organization logic has similarities to XML, but has different notation. We use JSON as a unified language for exchanging data between different applications, currently JSON is widely used in all cycles from the database to the Front-end.

###  **JSON-Schema - JSON-Schema Machine Object**

> JSON Schema is an IETF standard providing a format for what JSON data is required for a given application and how to interact with it. In this sense, in programming we use JSON-Schema as a way to specify to programs the characteristics of the object being passed, so we follow this template to fill in the fields with attributes of the objects of each scenario.

###  **Abstract - How to perform graphical visualization of data using JSON**

> Relational databases model data with a set of predetermined structures, then it becomes complex the joins of these sets of tables for content analysis,
thus, efforts are valid to present techniques more efficient analysis and visualization of information. In this research we present how to perform graphical visualization of data using JSON Graph that introduces new primitive types to JSON to allow JSON to be used to represent chart information in a simple and consistent way.

###  **Guide - How to Migrate to Advanced Manufacturing**

> This document has sought to provide initial guidance on integrating and standardizing legacy systems to catch up with advanced manufacturing systems. In a first approximation, we provide a simplified architecture of the RAMI 4.0 plan axis, after understanding the new structure of the system, a diagram of steps was provided for the gradual migration of legacy systems until they reach the different applications of I4.0. Finally, we deal with an example of data flow control, considering the new information structure for a later implementation of the different AAS.

###  **Report Analysis and Classification of the Adult dataset - 01**

> A popular example is the adult income dataset that involves predicting personal income levels as above or below
  Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. Also known as "Adult" dataset.
    50K than above $50K, although the skew is not severe.
This means that techniques for imbalanced classification can be used whilst model performance can still be reported using classification accuracy, as is used with balanced classification problems.

###  **Report Analysis and Classification of the Adult dataset - 02**

> In this second experiment, practice of classification techniques is carried out based on the “Adult Dataset” being
composed of a data set of adults' personal income above or below U$ 50K/year. For this we use the classifiers Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
A report and graphical analysis of the classifiers are provided.

###  **A review of platforms for the development of agent systems**

> This table was stracted from https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08961 and presents a up-to-date review of the existing agent platforms and also a historical perspective of this domain. It aims to serve as a reference point for people interested in developing agent systems. This work details the main characteristics of the included agent platforms, together with links to specific projects where they have been used.
