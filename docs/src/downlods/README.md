# Content Sharing - Downloads

Our goal is to create an area to share digital knowledge offering classes and consulting:


###  **JSON - Example of JSON Machine Object**

> The JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format is an open format used as an alternative to XML for transferring structured data between a web server and a web application. Its organization logic has similarities to XML, but has different notation. We use JSON as a unified language for exchanging data between different applications, currently JSON is widely used in all cycles from the database to the Front-end.

###  **JSON-Schema - JSON-Schema Machine Object**

> JSON Schema is an IETF standard providing a format for what JSON data is required for a given application and how to interact with it. In this sense, in programming we use JSON-Schema as a way to specify to programs the characteristics of the object being passed, so we follow this template to fill in the fields with attributes of the objects of each scenario.

###  **Abstract - How to perform graphical visualization of data using JSON**

> Relational databases model data with a set of predetermined structures, then it becomes complex the joins of these sets of tables for content analysis,
thus, efforts are valid to present techniques more efficient analysis and visualization of information. In this research we present how to perform graphical visualization of data using JSON Graph that introduces new primitive types to JSON to allow JSON to be used to represent chart information in a simple and consistent way.

###  **Guide - How to Produce a Scientific Academic Article**

> This guide aims to present descriptions that support the six main pillars for the development of a scientific article. The content describes each of the topics, presents an opinion of the author based on publishing experiences and bonus with links to indexed bases and references

###  **Guide - How to Migrate to Advanced Manufacturing**

> This document has sought to provide initial guidance on integrating and standardizing legacy systems to catch up with advanced manufacturing systems. In a first approximation, we provide a simplified architecture of the RAMI 4.0 plan axis, after understanding the new structure of the system, a diagram of steps was provided for the gradual migration of legacy systems until they reach the different applications of I4.0. Finally, we deal with an example of data flow control, considering the new information structure for a later implementation of the different AAS.

###  **Report Analysis and Classification of the Adult dataset - 01**

> A popular example is the adult income dataset that involves predicting personal income levels as above or below
  Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. Also known as "Adult" dataset.
    50K than above $50K, although the skew is not severe.
This means that techniques for imbalanced classification can be used whilst model performance can still be reported using classification accuracy, as is used with balanced classification problems.

###  **Report Analysis and Classification of the Adult dataset - 02**

> In this second experiment, practice of classification techniques is carried out based on the “Adult Dataset” being
composed of a data set of adults' personal income above or below U$ 50K/year. For this we use the classifiers Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
A report and graphical analysis of the classifiers are provided.

###  **A review of platforms for the development of agent systems**

> This table was stracted from https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08961 and presents a up-to-date review of the existing agent platforms and also a historical perspective of this domain. It aims to serve as a reference point for people interested in developing agent systems. This work details the main characteristics of the included agent platforms, together with links to specific projects where they have been used.

###  **Internet Movie Database to Task-01**

> IMDb, also known as the Internet Movie Database, is an online database of information about TV movies, music and games, now owned by Amazon.
We will use this basis for data analysis practices in Task 01 - working with data.

###  **Event_data Dataset to Task-02**

> Download the event_data.csv dataset, which contains data on the use of the mobile application of users who registered from July 29 to September 1, 2019.
We will use this basis for data analysis practices in Task 02 - working with data.

###  **Transforming JSON dictionaries into Datatable and vice versa - Task-03**

> In this training activity, the challenge was to load a Json dictionary and using the methods of this library to transform it into a table using Pandas. We also use the additional ast-python library to find out programmatically what the current grammar looks like..
