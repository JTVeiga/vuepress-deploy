# Content Sharing - Downloads

Our goal is to create an area to share digital knowledge offering classes and consulting:


###  **Guide - How to Produce a Scientific Academic Article**

> This guide aims to present descriptions that support the six main pillars for the development of a scientific article. The content describes each of the topics, presents an opinion of the author based on publishing experiences and bonus with links to indexed bases and references

###  **Guide - How to Migrate to Advanced Manufacturing**

> This document has sought to provide initial guidance on integrating and standardizing legacy systems to catch up with advanced manufacturing systems. In a first approximation, we provide a simplified architecture of the RAMI 4.0 plan axis, after understanding the new structure of the system, a diagram of steps was provided for the gradual migration of legacy systems until they reach the different applications of I4.0. Finally, we deal with an example of data flow control, considering the new information structure for a later implementation of the different AAS.

###  **Report Analysis and Classification of the Adult dataset - 01**

> A popular example is the adult income dataset that involves predicting personal income levels as above or below
  Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. Also known as "Adult" dataset.
    50K than above $50K, although the skew is not severe.
This means that techniques for imbalanced classification can be used whilst model performance can still be reported using classification accuracy, as is used with balanced classification problems.

###  **Report Analysis and Classification of the Adult dataset - 02**

> In this second experiment, practice of classification techniques is carried out based on the “Adult Dataset” being
composed of a data set of adults' personal income above or below U$ 50K/year. For this we use the classifiers Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
A report and graphical analysis of the classifiers are provided.

###  **A review of platforms for the development of agent systems**

> This table was stracted from https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08961 and presents a up-to-date review of the existing agent platforms and also a historical perspective of this domain. It aims to serve as a reference point for people interested in developing agent systems. This work details the main characteristics of the included agent platforms, together with links to specific projects where they have been used.

###  **Internet Movie Database to Task-01**

> IMDb, also known as the Internet Movie Database, is an online database of information about TV movies, music and games, now owned by Amazon.
We will use this basis for data analysis practices in Task 01 - working with data.

###  **Event_data Dataset to Task-02**

> Download the event_data.csv dataset, which contains data on the use of the mobile application of users who registered from July 29 to September 1, 2019.
We will use this basis for data analysis practices in Task 02 - working with data.
