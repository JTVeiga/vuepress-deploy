###  **Guide - How to Migrate to Advanced Manufacturing**

> This document has sought to provide initial guidance on integrating and standardizing legacy systems to catch up with advanced manufacturing systems. In a first approximation, we provide a simplified architecture of the RAMI 4.0 plan axis, after understanding the new structure of the system, a diagram of steps was provided for the gradual migration of legacy systems until they reach the different applications of I4.0. Finally, we deal with an example of data flow control, considering the new information structure for a later implementation of the different AAS.
