> This document has sought to provide initial guidance on integrating and standardizing legacy systems to catch up with advanced manufacturing systems. In a first approximation, we provide a simplified architecture of the RAMI 4.0 plan axis, after understanding the new structure of the system, a diagram of steps was provided for the gradual migration of legacy systems until they reach the different applications of I4.0.
