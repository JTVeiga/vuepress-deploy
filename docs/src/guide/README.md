  **Flight level planning analysis from the standalone UAV perspective**

This work is a research on optimization of autonomous vehicle path planning with analysis of safety parameters and airspace dimensioning following risk regulations. This study intends to generate mathematical algorithms that will be later inserted and tested in optimizers, for example A*, RRT, etc.

  **Development of training Sessions - Applications of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)**

Working on the development of training sessions on - i) Applications using Multi-Agent Systems (MAS): This content aims to demonstrate in a practical way with small models aimed at a language close to - 1) manufacturing processes, and 2) virtual assets. I'm separating some scripts that make it easy to understand by simulation of MAS and functional models based on DES - Discret Event Systems. Please wait..

  **Building a platform for cooperation between engineers and developers**

This web-page project was developed in Vuepress, however, based on the lessons learned in Django and Vue-js acquired in the construction of the Webstation-ASA, in recent months I have been working on a platform that aims to host works, research and development that contribute to I4.0 digitalization.

  **Web-Station Aerospace Simulation Environment - ASA**

  The Aerospace Simulation Environment (Ambiente de Simulação Aeroespacial -- ASA in Portuguese) is a custom-made object-oriented simulation framework developed mainly in C++ that enables the modeling and simulation of military operational scenarios to support the development of tactics and procedures in the aerospace context for the Brazilian Air Force.
  Actually I am develloping the Web-Station to interact with the ASA architecture, this web-service ennables the decision maker to create and analyze combat strategy needs with a friendly GUI interface.

  **Proposta de um Método para Controle de Coalizão de Recursos Virtuais baseados em Multi-agentes no contexto I4.0**

  The current work proposes a method for the control and coalition of resources of a productive system based on multi-agents, through the virtualization of these resources in the context of I4.0. The proposal describes a methodology that allows the migration of manufacturing systems, an analysis of the dynamic behavior allows validating of the models conceived in High-Level Petri Nets (PFS) and Condition/Event Petri Nets (RdP C/E) that meet concepts of conservative components. The process simulation demonstrates the adequacy of the designed models, meeting the modeling requirements and behavioral properties. As there are still challenges to implementing the concepts used, the author hopes to contribute to migration and help in the design of control method models adapted to the guidelines of RAMI .40. A conceptual case study demonstrates the application of the method, in which the MAS control orchestrates AAS generating coalition tables that allow better use of resource services, which are re-planned in real-time..

  **A Systematic Modelling Procedure to Design Agent-Oriented Control to Coalition of Capabilities—In the Context of I4. 0 as Virtual Assets (AAS)**

  This article continues with the work to model the MAS control system to perform the discovery and grouping of functionalities in AAS. In this paper it is possible to notice more clearly the chosen approaches and simulation structure to control the resource capabilities elements (skill).

  **Intelligent Manufacturing Systems: Self-organization in the I4. 0 context**

  Traditional manufacturing systems must implement more flexibility and reconfigurability in their control structure to deal with predictably utilizing resource functionality. The context of Industry 4.0 standardizes assets with Component I4.0 (I4.0C). This work presents an architecture proposal to deal with these systems and mechanisms for self-organization of functionalities in manufacturing systems in the I4.0 context.

  **Control of Manufacturing Systems by HMS/EPS Paradigms Orchestrating I4. 0 Components Based on Capabilities**

  This article continues the research project on the adequacy of traditional manufacturing systems with regard to the integration and relationship of virtual elements. In this work, greater focus was given to the design of activities for reasoning. Therefore, a manufacturing systems control framework is proposed based on capabilities and HMS/EPS application to orchestrate I4.0C.

  **Controle de Sistemas de Manufatura Distribuídos no contexto da Indústria 4.0**

  This was my first papper presented in a congress, despite dealing with the initial stages of the research, in this article it is possible to extract important information about terms and architecture for vertical integration of legacy systems in the industry. The results provide an architecture between the virtual components for data standardization and a simplified relationship diagram for message exchange.
